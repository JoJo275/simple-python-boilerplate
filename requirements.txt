# Runtime dependencies for simple-python-boilerplate
#
# This file is OPTIONAL. The source of truth for dependencies is
# pyproject.toml, managed via Hatch (https://hatch.pypa.io/).
# Preferred install methods:
#   pip install -e .       (editable install from pyproject.toml)
#   hatch shell            (enter Hatch-managed dev environment)
#
# This file exists for tools and workflows that require a requirements.txt
# (e.g., pip-audit, Dependabot, Docker builds without Hatch).
# Keep it in sync with [project].dependencies in pyproject.toml.
#
# TODO (template users): Add your runtime dependencies below, matching
#   what you put in [project].dependencies in pyproject.toml. If you
#   add version pins here, keep them aligned with pyproject.toml.
#   If you only use Hatch and never need a plain requirements.txt,
#   you can delete this file entirely.
#
# Add your runtime dependencies below:
# requests>=2.28
# click>=8.0
