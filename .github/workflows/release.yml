#   1. Enable the repository guard (pick ONE):
#        Option A – Replace 'YOURNAME/YOURTEMPLATE' below with
#                   your actual repo slug (e.g. 'myorg/myproject').

#                   (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables)
#   2. Add a PUBLISH_TOKEN secret for PyPI publishing
#      (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets).
