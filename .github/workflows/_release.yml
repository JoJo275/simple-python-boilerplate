# Release Workflow

# Builds Python distribution artifacts (sdist + wheel) and
# optionally publishes them to PyPI.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Pushing a semver tag like v1.2.3
#   - Manual dispatch via the GitHub Actions UI
#
# Setup required:
#   1. Replace 'YOURNAME/YOURTEMPLATE' with your repo slug, OR
#      set repository variables CANONICAL_REPO and ENABLE_RELEASE.
#   2. Add a PUBLISH_TOKEN secret for PyPI publishing
#      (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets).
