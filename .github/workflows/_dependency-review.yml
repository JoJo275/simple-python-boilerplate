# Dependency Review Workflow
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Scans pull requests for newly introduced dependencies and
# flags any that are vulnerable, have restrictive licenses,
# or are otherwise risky.
#
# Uses GitHub's dependency-review-action which compares the
# dependency graph before and after the PR's changes.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Pull requests targeting main
#
# TODO (template users):
#   1. Rename this file from _dependency-review.yml →
#      dependency-review.yml to put it into an active state
#      (ready for use). The underscore prefix keeps it inactive
#      until you are ready to enable it.
#   2. Enable the repository guard (pick ONE):
#        Option A – Replace 'YOURNAME/YOURTEMPLATE' below with
#                   your actual repo slug (e.g. 'myorg/myproject').
#        Option B – Set two repository-level variables (no YAML
#                   edits needed):
#                     vars.CANONICAL_REPO = 'myorg/myproject'
#                     vars.ENABLE_RELEASE = 'true'
#                   (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables)
#   3. (Optional) Configure license allow/deny lists and
#      severity thresholds in the step below.
