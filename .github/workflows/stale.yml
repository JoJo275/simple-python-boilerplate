# Stale Workflow
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Automatically marks issues and PRs as stale after a period of
# inactivity, then closes them if no further activity occurs.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Daily schedule (00:00 UTC)
#   - Manual dispatch via the GitHub Actions UI
#
# TODO (template users):
#   1. Enable the repository guard (pick ONE):
#        Option A – Replace 'YOURNAME/YOURTEMPLATE' below with
#                   your actual repo slug (e.g. 'myorg/myproject').
#        Option B – Set a repository variable (no YAML edits needed):
#                     vars.ENABLE_STALE = 'true'
#                   (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables)
#   2. (Optional) Adjust the day counts and labels below.

    # Cron is a Unix time-scheduling syntax and the only way to

    #   │ ┌─── hour (0–23)
    #   │ │ ┌─── day of month (1–31)
