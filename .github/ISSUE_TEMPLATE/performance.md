<!--
Thanks for reporting a performance issue! ⚡

Performance issues help us keep the project fast and efficient.
Please provide as much detail as possible, including measurements and reproduction steps.

⚠️ Before submitting:
- For general bugs (not performance-related), use the Bug Report template.
- For feature requests to improve performance, use the Feature Request template.
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- If possible, include benchmark data or profiling results.

## Performance Details

### Issue Type
<!-- Select one -->
- [ ] Performance regression (was faster before)
- [ ] Slow operation / High latency
- [ ] High memory usage
- [ ] High CPU usage
- [ ] Memory leak
- [ ] Slow startup time
- [ ] Inefficient resource usage
- [ ] Scaling issue (performance degrades with size)
- [ ] Unsure
- [ ] Other: <!-- describe -->

### Affected Area
<!-- Select one -->
- [ ] Core library / API
- [ ] CLI
- [ ] Startup / Initialization
- [ ] Data processing
- [ ] I/O operations
- [ ] Network / HTTP operations
- [ ] Memory management
- [ ] Multiple areas
- [ ] Unsure
- [ ] Other: <!-- describe -->

### Description
<!-- Describe the performance issue. What operation is slow? When did you first notice it? -->



### Severity
<!-- Select one -->
- [ ] Critical – Makes the project unusable
- [ ] High – Significantly impacts workflow
- [ ] Medium – Noticeable slowdown but usable
- [ ] Low – Minor performance concern
- [ ] Unsure

### Reproducibility
<!-- Select one -->
- [ ] Always reproducible
- [ ] Intermittent / Flaky
- [ ] Only under specific conditions
- [ ] First run only (cold start)
- [ ] Unsure

### Is this a regression?
<!-- Select one -->
- [ ] Yes – This was faster in a previous version
- [ ] No – This has always been slow
- [ ] Unsure

**Last known good version (if regression):**
<!-- e.g., 0.9.0, or commit hash. Leave blank if not a regression. -->

## Environment & Reproduction

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **OS** | <!-- e.g., Windows 11 / macOS 14 / Ubuntu 22.04 --> |
| **Python Version** | <!-- e.g., 3.11.5 --> |
| **Package Version** | <!-- e.g., 0.1.0 --> |
| **Hardware** (optional) | <!-- e.g., 8-core CPU, 16GB RAM, SSD --> |

### Input Size / Data Characteristics (Optional)
<!-- Describe the size or characteristics of the input that triggers the issue. -->
<!--
- Number of records: 100,000
- File size: 500MB
- Iterations: 10,000
-->



### Sample Data (Optional)
<!-- If you can share data that reproduces the issue, provide a link or describe how to generate it. -->
<!--
Link: https://gist.github.com/...
Or: "Run `generate_test_data(n=100000)` to create equivalent data"
Or: "Data is confidential, but it's a 500MB CSV with 100k rows"
-->



### Steps to Reproduce
<!-- Steps to reproduce the performance issue -->
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Minimal Reproduction Code (Optional)
```python
# Paste your code here
```

## Measurements

### Timing Measurements (Optional)
<!-- Compare current vs. expected timing -->
<!--
Current:
- Operation takes ~15 seconds
- Throughput: 100 records/second

Expected:
- Should be <1 second
- Previous version (v0.9.0): 200ms
-->



### Memory Measurements (Optional)
<!-- Compare current vs. expected memory usage -->
<!--
Current:
- Memory usage peaks at 2GB
- Memory grows by 100MB per iteration

Expected:
- Should be <500MB peak
- Previous version: stable at 200MB
-->



### Profiling Data (Optional)
<!-- If you have profiling results (cProfile, memory_profiler, py-spy, etc.), paste them here -->
```
# Paste profiling output here
```
