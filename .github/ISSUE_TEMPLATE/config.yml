# config.yml can be used to generate buttons on the issue template selection on GitHub.
# This can reduce developer workload by directing users to relevant resources
# before they create an issue.
#
# Basically giving users the correct tools instead of creating an unwarranted issue
# if the information is already available elsewhere.
