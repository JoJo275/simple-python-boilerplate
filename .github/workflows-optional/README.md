# Optional Workflows

This directory contains **optional workflow templates** that are not active by default.

## How to Use

1. **Copy** a workflow from here into `.github/workflows/`
2. **Follow the TODO** comments at the top of the file to configure it
3. **Enable the repository guard** (replace `YOURNAME/YOURREPO` or set the
   corresponding `vars.ENABLE_*` variable)
4. The workflow will become active on the next push

## Why a Separate Directory?

GitHub Actions only executes workflows in `.github/workflows/`.
Files here are inert — they serve as a library of ready-to-use templates
you can adopt when your project needs them.

## Available Templates

<!-- TODO (template users): Remove entries from this table as you move
     workflows into .github/workflows/. Delete this directory when empty. -->

| File                    | Purpose                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs.yml`              | Build and deploy documentation (e.g. MkDocs, Sphinx) |
| `dependency-review.yml` | Scan PRs for vulnerable or restricted dependencies   |
| `labeler.yml`           | Auto-label PRs based on file paths changed           |

## After Adopting

Once you've moved all the templates you need into `.github/workflows/`,
you can delete this directory entirely to reduce clutter.
