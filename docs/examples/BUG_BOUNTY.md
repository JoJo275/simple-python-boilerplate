# Bug Bounty Program

> **⚠️ THIS IS A TEMPLATE — NOT AN ACTIVE BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM**
> 
> **This document is an example only. It is NOT active for this repository.**  
> **Do not submit vulnerability reports expecting rewards for this template repo.**
> 
> To use this template: copy it to your own repository, replace all placeholders, and link it from your SECURITY.md.


## Overview

We offer rewards for responsibly disclosed security vulnerabilities in [PROJECT NAME]. This program encourages security researchers to help us identify and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

> **Legal disclaimer:** Nothing in this document creates a legal obligation to pay. All rewards, if any, are offered at our sole discretion based on the severity, impact, and quality of the report.

## Scope

### In Scope

<!-- TODO: Replace all placeholders below with your actual values -->

The following are eligible for rewards:

- **Primary repository:** `https://github.com/[OWNER]/[REPO]`
- **Official releases:** Packages published to PyPI under `[package-name]` (latest stable release and currently supported versions)
- **Documentation site:** `https://[your-docs-domain].com` (if applicable)
- **Only assets owned/operated by us** — We can only authorize testing on infrastructure we control
- **Only vulnerabilities that affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability in a meaningful way** — Theoretical issues or best-practice deviations without real-world impact are out of scope

### Version Coverage

<!-- TODO: Specify which versions are in scope. See docs/RELEASE_POLICY.md (if available) for version support details. -->

| Version | In Scope |
|---------|----------|
| Latest stable release | ✅ Yes |
| Supported versions (per release policy) | ✅ Yes |
| Unsupported / EOL versions | ❌ No |
| Pre-release / beta | ❌ No (unless explicitly invited) |

### Vulnerability Types

<!-- TODO: Replace $X values with your actual reward amounts, or remove monetary rewards entirely -->

| Severity | Examples | Reward Range |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, authentication bypass, data breach | $[X] – $[Y] | 
| **High** | Privilege escalation, significant data exposure, injection attacks | $[X] – $[Y] |
| **Medium** | Cross-site scripting (XSS), CSRF, information disclosure | $[X] – $[Y] |
| **Low** | Minor information leaks, theoretical attacks | Recognition only |

> **⚠️ Template Note:** Rewards are discretionary. Projects using this template may offer recognition only, swag, or no rewards at all. Adjust or remove this table based on your actual budget and commitment.

> **Severity calibration:** We use [CVSS 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1) or similar frameworks to help calibrate severity. Final severity is determined by the maintainers based on actual impact to this project.

> **Minimum for monetary rewards:** Only Medium severity and above are eligible for monetary rewards (if offered). Low severity issues receive recognition in our Hall of Fame.

### Out of Scope

The following are **not eligible** for rewards:

- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (report to upstream)
- Issues requiring physical access to a user's device
- Social engineering attacks (phishing, etc.)
- Denial of service (DoS/DDoS) attacks
- Issues in non-production environments (staging, dev)
- Previously reported vulnerabilities
- Vulnerabilities disclosed publicly before we can address them
- Automated scanner output without proof of exploitability
- Best-practice findings with no demonstrable security impact (e.g., missing headers without exploit path)
- Rate-limit bypass claims without demonstrated security impact
- **User-hosted deployments / forks / self-hosted instances** — Unless explicitly included above, we cannot authorize testing on infrastructure we don't control

## Rules of Engagement

To qualify for a reward, you must:

1. **Report privately** — Do not disclose publicly until we've released a fix
2. **Provide details** — Include steps to reproduce, impact assessment, and PoC
3. **Act in good faith** — Do not access, modify, or delete user data
4. **Test responsibly** — Only test against your own instances or with explicit permission
5. **One report per issue** — Do not submit duplicates or variants of the same issue

### Duplicate Reports

If multiple researchers report the same vulnerability:

- The **first valid report** receives the full reward
- Subsequent reports may receive partial recognition (but no monetary reward)
- We determine duplicates based on the timestamp of the report submission
- If reports arrive within the same 24-hour period with substantially different details, we may split the reward at our discretion

### Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Follow the rules outlined in this policy
- Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations and service disruption
- Report vulnerabilities promptly and work with us on remediation

> **⚠️ Important:** Safe harbor applies only to authorized testing within the scope of this policy and does not permit unlawful access to systems, data exfiltration, or any activity that violates applicable laws. When in doubt, ask before testing.

## How to Report

<!-- ⚠️ TODO: Replace [OWNER]/[REPO] and security@example.com with your actual values before publishing! -->

**If you are using this as a template:** Replace the link, email, and all placeholders below before publishing. Do not ship this file with example values.

1. **Preferred:** [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/[OWNER]/[REPO]/security/advisories/new)  
   **⚠️ TODO:** Replace `[OWNER]/[REPO]` with your actual repository path
2. **Email:** `[security-email]@[your-domain].com`
3. **PGP Encrypted:** See key details below (if available)

<!-- TODO: Add your PGP key fingerprint (full 40-character format):
Key fingerprint: `XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX`
Public key: https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security@example.com
-->

For general security information, see our [Security Policy](../../SECURITY.md).

### What to Include

- **Summary:** Brief description of the vulnerability
- **Severity:** Your assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed instructions or proof-of-concept
- **Impact:** What could an attacker achieve?
- **Affected Versions:** Which versions are vulnerable?
- **Suggested Fix:** Optional but appreciated

## Response Timeline

| Action | Timeframe |
|--------|----------|
| Acknowledgment | Target: within 72 hours |
| Initial triage | Target: within 7 days |
| Status update | Target: every 7 days during investigation |
| Fix deployed | Varies by severity (target: 30–90 days) |
| Reward issued (if applicable) | Target: within 30 days of fix deployment |

> **Note:** These are targets, not guarantees. Small teams or volunteer maintainers may need more time. We will communicate delays proactively.
