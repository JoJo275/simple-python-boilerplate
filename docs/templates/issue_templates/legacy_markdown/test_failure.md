## ⚠️ Before submitting

- [ ] **Not an application bug** – Use the [Bug Report](https://github.com/JoJo275/simple-python-boilerplate/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) template if the test is exposing a real bug
- [ ] **Not a security issue** – Do **not** open a public issue for vulnerabilities. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/JoJo275/simple-python-boilerplate/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
- [ ] **Searched for duplicates** – No [existing issue](https://github.com/JoJo275/simple-python-boilerplate/issues) covers this

<!-- Select one: -->
- [ ] Always fails
- [ ] Flaky (fails sometimes)

- [ ] No – This is a new test
- [ ] No – This test has always been flaky
- [ ] Unsure

**Last known passing (if regression):**

## Environment

### Where does this fail?

<!-- Select one: -->
- [ ] Local development
- [ ] CI/CD (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- [ ] Both local and CI
- [ ] Unsure

**Python Version (if local):**
<!-- e.g., 3.11.5 -->


**Commit / Branch / Release:**
<!-- e.g., abc1234, main, or v1.2.0 -->


**CI Run Link (if applicable):**
<!-- e.g., https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/... -->


**CI Job Name + Runner OS (if applicable):**
<!-- For matrix failures: e.g., test (ubuntu-latest, 3.11) -->


**Flake Rate / Frequency (if intermittent):**
<!-- e.g., ~1 in 20 runs, or 3 times this week -->


**Test Command Used:**
<!-- If not just `pytest`, e.g., pytest -x -v tests/ --timeout=60 -->

## Reproduction (Optional)

<!-- Skip if it's just "run the test." Add extra steps only if needed. -->

<!--
Usually just:
1. pip install -e ".[dev]"
2. Run the test command above

Add extra steps only if needed (e.g., specific env vars, seed data, timing).

## Additional Context

### Analysis / Suspected Cause (Optional)

<!-- Any insights into what might be causing the failure? -->


### Other Tests Affected? (Optional)

<!-- Are other tests also failing or flaky? e.g., test_auth.py also times out -->
