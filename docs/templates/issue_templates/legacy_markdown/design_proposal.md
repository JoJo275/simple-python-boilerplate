⚠️ **Before submitting**
- **Security vulnerability?** Do **not** open a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/JoJo275/simple-python-boilerplate/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
- **Small enhancement?** Use the [Feature Request](https://github.com/JoJo275/simple-python-boilerplate/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) template instead.
- **Early-stage idea?** Start in [Discussions](https://github.com/JoJo275/simple-python-boilerplate/discussions) (Ideas/Proposals) first.
- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/JoJo275/simple-python-boilerplate/issues) and discussions to avoid duplicates.

💡 **Discussions vs. Design Proposals:** If you want brainstorming or feedback on a rough idea, use Discussions. Use this template when you have a **concrete proposal** ready for review.
