### Completed

- [X] Explore `hatch` as alternative to setuptools
- [X] Explore using `hatch` for project management and packaging
- [X] Explore using `hatch` for project management and packaging as an alternative to setuptools
- [X] Where do database files go? (e.g., SQLite files) Should they be in a `data/` directory or something else?
- [X] What is sponsorships and should I allow them for this project? *From what I've read, GitHub Sponsors is a way for open source maintainers to receive financial support from the community. It can be a good way to fund ongoing maintenance and development of the project, but it also requires some effort to set up and manage. I should research how to set it up and decide if it's appropriate for this project based on my goals and expected user base. Also could enable it for example purposes and to learn about the process, even if I don't expect to receive sponsorships right away.*
- [X] Integrate hatch
- [X] use containerfile for consistent development environments and to simplify setup for new contributors. *This would involve creating a `Containerfile` (or `Dockerfile`) that defines a consistent development environment with all necessary dependencies and tools installed. This would allow new contributors to quickly get up and running without having to manually set up their environment, and it would also ensure that everyone is using the same versions of tools and libraries, reducing the chances of environment-related issues.*
- [X] investigate spb clean --todo not working — resolved: the correct command is `spb-clean --todo` (hyphenated entry point), not `spb clean --todo`
- [X] Set up PR workflow
- [X] Verify different PR workflows
- [X] Refactor BUG_BOUNTY.md, SECURITY_no_bounty.md, and SECURITY_with_bounty.md to remove duplication and improve clarity.
