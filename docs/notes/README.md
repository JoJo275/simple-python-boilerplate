# Notes

This directory contains personal notes, learnings, and references captured while building this project.

> **Why a README here?** When you have multiple note files, this README serves as an index and explains the purpose of the directory. It helps future-you (and others) understand what's here and how it's organized.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [learning.md](learning.md) | Key concepts, gotchas, and things I keep forgetting |
| [tool-comparison.md](tool-comparison.md) | Quick reference for choosing between similar tools |
| [todo.md](todo.md) | Ideas, things to explore, and bookmarks |

## Purpose

These notes are:

- **Personal** — Written for myself as a learning aid
- **Informal** — Not polished documentation
- **Living** — Updated as I learn new things

Unlike ADRs (which document decisions), these notes capture knowledge and serve as a quick reference.

## Adding New Notes

When adding a new note file:

1. Create a descriptive filename (e.g., `debugging-tips.md`)
2. Add a brief entry to the table above
3. Keep notes focused on a single topic
