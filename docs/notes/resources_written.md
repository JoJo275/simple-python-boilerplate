## Git Commands Reference

A practical reference for Git commands used day-to-day when working on this
project. Commands are grouped by workflow stage.

### Setup & Configuration

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` | Set your name for all repos |
| `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"` | Set your email for all repos |
| `git config --local user.email "work@company.com"` | Override email for this repo only |
| `git config --list --show-origin` | Show all settings and which file defines each one |
| `git config --show-origin <key>` | Show where a specific setting comes from |
| `git config --global init.defaultBranch main` | Use `main` as the default branch name for new repos |
| `git config --global pull.rebase true` | Make `git pull` rebase instead of merge by default |
| `git config --global push.autoSetupRemote true` | Auto-set upstream when pushing a new branch |
| `git config --global rerere.enabled true` | Remember how you resolved conflicts so Git can auto-resolve them next time |
| `git config --global fetch.prune true` | Auto-remove stale remote-tracking branches on fetch |

> **See also:** [git-config-reference.md](../../git-config-reference.md) for a
> comprehensive config reference with recommended values.

### Creating & Switching Branches

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `git switch main` | Switch to the `main` branch |
| `git switch -c feature/my-feature` | Create a new branch and switch to it |
| `git switch -c feature/my-feature origin/main` | Create a new branch based on remote `main` (not local) |
| `git checkout -b feature/my-feature` | Same as `switch -c` (older syntax, still works) |
| `git branch` | List local branches (current branch marked with `*`) |
| `git branch -a` | List all branches (local + remote-tracking) |
| `git branch -d feature/done` | Delete a local branch (only if fully merged) |
| `git branch -D feature/abandoned` | Force-delete a local branch (even if unmerged) |
| `git branch --show-current` | Print the name of the current branch |
| `git branch -m old-name new-name` | Rename a local branch |

### Daily Workflow

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `git status` | Show working tree status (modified, staged, untracked files) |
| `git status -sb` | Short status with branch info (compact view) |
| `git add <file>` | Stage a specific file for the next commit |
| `git add -A` | Stage all changes (new, modified, deleted files) |
| `git add -p` | Interactively stage hunks — lets you commit parts of a file |
| `git restore <file>` | Discard uncommitted changes in a file (revert to last commit) |
| `git restore --staged <file>` | Unstage a file (keep changes in working directory) |
| `git diff` | Show unstaged changes |
| `git diff --staged` | Show staged changes (what will go into the next commit) |
| `git diff main..HEAD` | Show all changes between `main` and your current branch |

### Committing

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `git commit -m "feat: add login"` | Commit staged changes with a message |
| `git commit` | Open editor for a longer commit message |
| `git commit --amend` | Modify the last commit (message and/or content) |
| `git commit --amend --no-edit` | Add staged changes to the last commit without changing the message |
| `git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger CI"` | Create an empty commit (useful to re-trigger workflows) |
| `cz commit` | Interactive conventional commit via commitizen |

> **Warning:** `--amend` rewrites history. Only amend commits that haven't
> been pushed, or use `--force-with-lease` after amending a pushed commit.

### Syncing with Remote

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `git fetch origin` | Download latest commits/branches from remote (doesn't change your files) |
| `git pull --ff-only` | Pull only if it's a fast-forward (no merge commit created) |
| `git pull --rebase` | Pull and rebase your local commits on top of remote changes |
| `git push` | Push current branch to its upstream |
| `git push -u origin HEAD` | Push current branch and set upstream tracking (first push) |
| `git push --force-with-lease` | Force-push safely — refuses if remote has commits you haven't seen |
| `git push --force` | Force-push unconditionally — **dangerous**, can overwrite others' work |
| `git remote -v` | Show remote URLs (fetch and push) |

> **`--force-with-lease` vs `--force`:** Always prefer `--force-with-lease`.
> It's the safe version — it checks that the remote branch is where you
> expect it to be before overwriting. Plain `--force` overwrites blindly.

### Rebasing

Rebasing replays your commits on top of another branch. This keeps history
linear (which this project requires — see [ADR 022](../adr/022-rebase-merge-strategy.md)).

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `git rebase origin/main` | Replay current branch's commits on top of remote `main` |
| `git rebase -i HEAD~3` | Interactive rebase — edit, reorder, squash, or drop the last 3 commits |
| `git rebase --continue` | Continue rebase after resolving a conflict |
| `git rebase --abort` | Cancel the rebase and go back to the state before it started |
| `git rebase --skip` | Skip the current commit during rebase (use with caution) |

**Interactive rebase keywords:**

| Keyword | Short | What it does |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `pick` | `p` | Keep the commit as-is |
| `reword` | `r` | Keep the commit but edit its message |
| `edit` | `e` | Pause at this commit to amend it |
| `squash` | `s` | Merge into the previous commit (combine messages) |
| `fixup` | `f` | Merge into the previous commit (discard this message) |
| `drop` | `d` | Remove the commit entirely |

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

When a rebase or merge hits a conflict, Git pauses and marks the conflicted
files. The general workflow:

```bash
# 1. See which files are conflicted
git status

# 2. Open each conflicted file and resolve the conflict markers:
#    <<<<<<< HEAD
#    (your changes)
#    =======
#    (incoming changes)
#    >>>>>>> branch-name

# 3. After editing, mark the file as resolved
git add <resolved-file>

# 4. Continue the rebase (or merge)
git rebase --continue    # if rebasing
# or
git merge --continue     # if merging
```

**Conflict resolution on feature branches (recommended workflow):**

```bash
git checkout your-branch          # switch to your feature branch
git fetch origin                  # download latest main
git rebase origin/main            # replay your commits on top of updated main
# resolve conflicts file-by-file, then:
git push --force-with-lease       # update the remote branch
```

> **Don't resolve conflicts in GitHub's web editor** for this project.
> It creates a merge commit, which disables the "Rebase and merge" button.
> Always rebase locally. See [Releasing — Merge Conflicts on a Feature Branch](../releasing.md#merge-conflicts-on-a-feature-branch) for full details.

### Stashing

Stash temporarily shelves changes so you can switch branches without committing
unfinished work.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `git stash` | Stash tracked changes (staged + unstaged) |
| `git stash -u` | Stash everything including untracked files |
| `git stash list` | Show all stashes |
| `git stash pop` | Apply the most recent stash and remove it from the stash list |
| `git stash apply` | Apply the most recent stash but keep it in the list |
| `git stash drop` | Delete the most recent stash |
| `git stash show -p` | Show the diff of the most recent stash |

### Inspecting History

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `git log --oneline` | Compact log — one line per commit |
| `git log --oneline -10` | Show only the last 10 commits |
| `git log --oneline --graph --all` | Visual branch graph of all branches |
| `git log --author="Name"` | Filter commits by author |
| `git log --since="2 weeks ago"` | Filter commits by date |
| `git log main..HEAD` | Show commits on your branch that aren't on `main` |
| `git show <commit>` | Show the full diff and message of a specific commit |
| `git blame <file>` | Show who last modified each line of a file |
| `git reflog` | Show history of HEAD movements — useful for recovering lost commits |

### Undoing Things

| Command | What it does | Safe? |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `git restore <file>` | Discard uncommitted changes in a file | Yes (only affects working tree) |
| `git restore --staged <file>` | Unstage a file | Yes (only affects index) |
| `git commit --amend` | Rewrite the last commit | Rewrites history |
| `git revert <commit>` | Create a new commit that undoes a previous commit | Yes (additive) |
| `git reset --soft HEAD~1` | Undo last commit, keep changes staged | Rewrites history |
| `git reset --mixed HEAD~1` | Undo last commit, keep changes unstaged (default) | Rewrites history |
| `git reset --hard HEAD~1` | Undo last commit and **discard all changes** | **Destructive** + rewrites history |
| `git reflog` + `git reset --hard <sha>` | Recover from almost any mistake using reflog | Depends on target |

> **Rule of thumb:** Use `revert` for commits already pushed to a shared
> branch. Use `reset` only for local, unpushed commits.

### Tags

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `git tag` | List all tags |
| `git tag v1.0.0` | Create a lightweight tag |
| `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0"` | Create an annotated tag (recommended) |
| `git push origin v1.0.0` | Push a specific tag to remote |
| `git push origin --tags` | Push all tags to remote |
| `git tag -d v1.0.0` | Delete a local tag |
| `git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0` | Delete a remote tag |

> **In this project**, tags are created automatically by release-please.
> You shouldn't need to create tags manually unless doing a hotfix or
> special release.

### Cleaning Up

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `git branch -d feature/done` | Delete a merged local branch |
| `git fetch --prune` | Remove remote-tracking branches that no longer exist on remote |
| `git remote prune origin` | Same as above but without fetching |
| `git clean -fd` | Remove untracked files and directories (**destructive**) |
| `git clean -fdn` | Dry-run — show what `clean -fd` would delete |
| `git gc` | Run garbage collection to optimize the repo |

### Useful Aliases

These are optional but save keystrokes. Set them with
`git config --global alias.<name> "<command>"`:

```bash
git config --global alias.st "status -sb"
git config --global alias.co "checkout"
git config --global alias.sw "switch"
git config --global alias.br "branch"
git config --global alias.ci "commit"
git config --global alias.lg "log --oneline --graph --all --decorate"
git config --global alias.last "log -1 HEAD --stat"
git config --global alias.unstage "restore --staged"
git config --global alias.amend "commit --amend --no-edit"
git config --global alias.wip "commit -am 'wip: work in progress'"
```

After setting these, `git st` is equivalent to `git status -sb`, etc.
