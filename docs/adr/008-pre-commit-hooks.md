# ADR 008: Use pre-commit hooks for automated checks

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking) can run at several points:

1. **Manually** — Developer runs tools by hand
2. **Pre-commit hooks** — Automatically on `git commit`
3. **CI only** — Checks run in GitHub Actions after push
4. **Editor/IDE** — Real-time feedback while coding

Manual checks are error-prone (easy to forget). CI-only checks provide late feedback (errors found after push). Pre-commit hooks provide immediate, automatic feedback.

## Decision

Use the `pre-commit` framework to run checks automatically at three git stages: `pre-commit` (every commit), `commit-msg` (message validation), and `pre-push` (slower/thorough checks before push). Opt-in `manual` hooks are available for heavier tools.

## Hook Inventory

### Stage: pre-commit (every `git commit`)

| Hook | Source | What it does |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `trailing-whitespace` | pre-commit-hooks | Removes trailing whitespace |
| `end-of-file-fixer` | pre-commit-hooks | Ensures files end with newline |
| `check-yaml` | pre-commit-hooks | Validates YAML syntax |
| `check-toml` | pre-commit-hooks | Validates TOML syntax |
| `check-json` | pre-commit-hooks | Validates JSON syntax |
| `check-ast` | pre-commit-hooks | Validates Python syntax (catches SyntaxError) |
| `check-added-large-files` | pre-commit-hooks | Prevents files > 1 MB from being committed |
| `check-merge-conflict` | pre-commit-hooks | Detects leftover merge conflict markers |
| `check-case-conflict` | pre-commit-hooks | Detects files that would clash on case-insensitive filesystems |
| `debug-statements` | pre-commit-hooks | Catches `import pdb` / `breakpoint()` left in code |
| `detect-private-key` | pre-commit-hooks | Blocks private keys from being committed |
| `fix-byte-order-marker` | pre-commit-hooks | Removes UTF-8 BOM (causes subtle cross-platform bugs) |
| `name-tests-test` | pre-commit-hooks | Enforces `test_*.py` naming in `tests/` |
| `check-executables-have-shebangs` | pre-commit-hooks | Executables must have shebangs |
| `check-shebang-scripts-are-executable` | pre-commit-hooks | Shebang scripts must be `+x` |
| `check-symlinks` | pre-commit-hooks | Detects broken symlinks |
| `check-docstring-first` | pre-commit-hooks | Catches code placed before the module docstring |
| `no-commit-to-branch` | pre-commit-hooks | Prevents direct commits to `main` / `master` |
| `mixed-line-ending` | pre-commit-hooks | Normalises to LF (paired with `.gitattributes`) |
| `ruff` | ruff-pre-commit | Lint with auto-fix (replaces flake8, isort, pyupgrade, autopep8) |
| `ruff-format` | ruff-pre-commit | Format (replaces black) |
| `mypy` | mirrors-mypy | Static type checking on `src/` |
| `bandit` | PyCQA/bandit | Security linting (skips tests) |
| `validate-pyproject` | validate-pyproject | Validates `pyproject.toml` against PEP 621 |
| `typos` | crate-ci/typos | Spell checking (Rust-based, fast, broad detection) |
| `actionlint` | rhysd/actionlint | Lints GitHub Actions workflow files |
| `check-github-workflows` | check-jsonschema | Schema validation for `.github/workflows/` |
| `check-github-actions` | check-jsonschema | Schema validation for action.yml files |
| `check-dependabot` | check-jsonschema | Schema validation for `.github/dependabot.yml` |
| `no-do-not-commit-marker` | local (pygrep) | Blocks `@@DO_NOT_COMMIT` `@@` markers |
| `no-secrets-patterns` | local (pygrep) | Blocks hardcoded credentials / token patterns |
| `no-nul-bytes` | local (python) | Blocks NUL bytes in text files |
| `deptry` | local (system) | Detects unused, missing, and transitive dependencies |

### Stage: commit-msg (validates the commit message)

| Hook | Source | What it does |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `commitizen` | commitizen-tools | Validates messages against Conventional Commits format |

### Stage: pre-push (slower checks before `git push`)

| Hook | Source | What it does |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `tests` | local (system) | Runs full test suite via `hatch run test` |
| `pip-audit` | pypa/pip-audit | Vulnerability scan against OSV / PyPI advisory DB |
| `gitleaks` | gitleaks | Secret detection with 150+ curated rules + entropy analysis |

### Stage: manual (opt-in, run on demand)

| Hook | Source | Why opt-in |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `markdownlint-cli2` | DavidAnson | Node-based; heavier dependency footprint |
| `hadolint-docker` | hadolint | Requires Docker; also covered by Trivy misconfig in CI |
| `forbid-submodules` | pre-commit-hooks | Only needed if project policy forbids submodules |

## Alternatives Considered

### CI-only checks

Run all checks in GitHub Actions, not locally.

**Rejected because:** Late feedback; developers don't see errors until after push; wastes CI resources on obvious issues.

### Husky (Node.js)

Git hooks via npm/Node.js.

**Rejected because:** Adds Node.js dependency to a Python project; pre-commit is Python-native and well-integrated.

### Manual checks

Document commands and trust developers to run them.

**Rejected because:** Easy to forget; inconsistent across team; bad commits reach CI.

## Tool Selection Rationale

### Chosen over alternatives

| Tool chosen | Alternatives skipped | Why |
|-------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Ruff** (lint + format) | flake8, isort, pyupgrade, autopep8, black, prettier | Ruff subsumes all of these in a single Rust binary. Orders of magnitude faster. Also handles YAML/TOML/JSON validation via `check-yaml`/`check-toml`/`check-json`. |
| **typos** (spellcheck) | codespell (as a hook) | typos is Rust-based, faster, and has broader detection. codespell remains as a CI safety net (`spellcheck.yml`) with its independently curated wordlist — the two overlap ~80 % but each catches things the other misses. |
| **pip-audit** (vulnerability scan) | safety | pip-audit is the PyPA-maintained successor with OSV database support. safety's free tier has limitations and is no longer the recommended tool. |
| **gitleaks** (secret detection) | trufflehog, git-secrets | gitleaks has 150+ curated rules with entropy detection, is a single Go binary, and is actively maintained. Complements the fast regex-based `no-secrets-patterns` pygrep hook. |
| **deptry** (dependency hygiene) | — | No real alternative in the Python ecosystem. Detects unused, missing, and transitive dependencies by comparing `pyproject.toml` against actual imports. Runs as a local/system hook to access the project's installed packages. |
| **actionlint** (workflow linting) | — | The only mature GHA workflow linter. Catches expression errors, unknown runner labels, and missing action inputs before they hit CI. |

### Explicitly not adopted

| Tool | Why skipped |
|------|------------|
| **prettier** | Ruff handles Python formatting; `check-yaml`, `check-toml`, `check-json` cover config files. Adding a Node.js dependency for marginal benefit is not worth it. |
| **pyupgrade** | Ruff's `UP` rules include all pyupgrade checks. Running both is redundant. |
| **autopep8** | Same as above — Ruff's formatter and linter cover all autopep8 fixes. |
| **black** | `ruff-format` is a drop-in replacement, faster, and configured alongside the linter. |
| **isort** | `ruff check` with isort rules (`I`) handles import sorting. |
| **codespell** (as a hook) | typos is faster and broader. codespell runs in CI (`spellcheck.yml`) as a complementary safety net. |
| **safety** | pip-audit is the maintained PyPA successor. safety's free tier scans an older database subset. |
| **Husky** | Node.js-based git hooks. Adds a Node dependency to a Python project; pre-commit is Python-native. |

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Automatic** — No manual step to forget
- **Fast feedback** — Errors caught before commit, not after push
- **Consistent** — Same checks for all developers
- **Prevents bad commits** — Can't commit code that fails checks
- **CI backup** — CI still runs checks for contributors who skip hooks
- **Layered security** — Fast regex secrets check on commit, thorough gitleaks scan on push

### Negative

- **Setup required** — Developers must run `pre-commit install` (+ `--hook-type commit-msg` and `--hook-type pre-push`)
- **Can be bypassed** — `git commit --no-verify` skips hooks
- **Slower commits** — Adds time to commit process (mitigated: most hooks are sub-second)
- **Initial friction** — May block commits until code is fixed
- **deptry requires project venv** — Runs as local/system hook via `hatch run`; won't work in pre-commit's isolated env

### Mitigations

- Document setup in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Keep hooks fast (Ruff and typos are Rust-based, sub-second)
- Move slow hooks to `pre-push` stage (tests, pip-audit, gitleaks)
- CI runs same checks as safety net
- Allow `--no-verify` for WIP commits (CI will catch issues)

## Implementation

- [.pre-commit-config.yaml](../../.pre-commit-config.yaml) — Full hook configuration
- [_typos.toml](../../_typos.toml) — typos spellchecker config (explicit pointer via `--config`)
- [pyproject.toml](../../pyproject.toml) — `[tool.deptry]` and `[tool.bandit]` configuration; `pre-commit` and `deptry` in dev dependencies
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) — Setup instructions for contributors
