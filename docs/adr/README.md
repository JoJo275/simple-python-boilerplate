# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for this project.

ADRs are short documents that capture important architectural decisions made during development, along with their context and consequences.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR records a significant decision that affects the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques of a project.

## Format

Each ADR follows the structure defined in [template.md](template.md):

1. **Title** — Short descriptive name
2. **Status** — Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
3. **Context** — What is the issue or situation?
4. **Decision** — What did we decide?
5. **Alternatives Considered** — What else was evaluated and why was it rejected?
6. **Consequences** — What are the results (positive, negative, mitigations)?
7. **Implementation** — Links to the files that implement this decision
8. **References** — External docs, specs, or related ADRs

To create a new ADR, copy `template.md` to `NNN-short-title.md` and fill it in.
