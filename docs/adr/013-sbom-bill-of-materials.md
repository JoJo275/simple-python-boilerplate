# ADR 013: SBOM generation and distribution strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Software supply-chain transparency is increasingly expected by consumers, auditors, and regulators (e.g., US Executive Order 14028, EU Cyber Resilience Act). A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) provides a machine-readable inventory of every component in a software artifact, enabling vulnerability tracking, license compliance, and procurement decisions.

Two dominant SBOM standards exist:

| Standard | Governing body | Strengths |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **SPDX** (ISO/IEC 5962:2021) | Linux Foundation | ISO standard; strong license metadata; GitHub-native support |
| **CycloneDX** | OWASP / Ecma International (ECMA-424) | Purpose-built for security; rich vulnerability and service metadata |

Neither standard is a strict superset of the other. Producing both maximises interoperability with downstream tooling.

### Distribution channels considered

GitHub offers several complementary ways to surface SBOM data:

| Channel | What it provides | Who controls it |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1. **Dependency Graph "Export SBOM"** | SPDX JSON computed by GitHub from the dependency graph | GitHub (repo setting) |
| 2. **Actions artifact** | SBOM files downloadable from a workflow run | Our workflow |
| 3. **Release asset** | SBOM files attached to a GitHub Release | Our workflow |
| 4. **Dependency Submission API** | Dependency data pushed into GitHub's graph and alerts | Our workflow |

Channels 1 and 4 populate the same Dependency Graph UI but may differ because (1) uses GitHub's own resolver while (4) uses whatever our generator (Syft) detects.

### Generator tool considered

| Tool | Formats | Maintained | Notes |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Syft** (Anchore) | SPDX, CycloneDX | Active | Multi-ecosystem scanner; used via `anchore/sbom-action` |
| **CycloneDX CLI** | CycloneDX only | Active | Python-specific; would need a separate tool for SPDX |
| **pip-licenses** | Custom / CycloneDX | Active | License-focused; not a full SBOM generator |

## Decision

1. **Primary format: SPDX JSON** — aligns with GitHub's native support and ISO standardisation.
2. **Secondary format: CycloneDX JSON** — produced simultaneously for OWASP-ecosystem consumers.
3. **Generator: Syft** (via `anchore/sbom-action`) — single tool produces both formats; actively maintained; first-party GitHub Action available.
4. **Enable all four distribution channels simultaneously:**

   | Channel | Workflow | Authoritative? |
   |---------|----------|---------------|
   | 1. Dependency Graph export | Built-in (no workflow needed) | No — GitHub-computed, may differ |
   | 2. Actions artifact | `sbom.yml` | No — per-commit snapshot |
   | 3. Release asset | `release.yml` | **Yes — authoritative for each tagged version** |
   | 4. Dependency Submission API | `sbom.yml` (push to main) | No — enriches GitHub UI/alerts |

5. **Authoritative SBOM:** The release-asset SBOM (channel 3) attached to a tagged release is the authoritative SBOM for that version. It is generated from the same commit that produced the release artifacts.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Full supply-chain transparency in both major SBOM standards
- Consumers can download the authoritative SBOM from the Release page
- GitHub's Dependency Graph and Dependabot alerts are enriched via the Submission API
- Single tool (Syft) for both formats reduces maintenance burden
- Weekly scheduled runs catch newly disclosed vulnerabilities in existing dependency snapshots
- Aligns with industry direction (EO 14028, CRA, NTIA minimum elements)

### Negative

- Adds ~2–3 minutes of CI time per push/PR (SBOM generation)
- Release workflow gains an additional job (sbom), adding ~2 minutes to release time
- Four channels may confuse consumers about which SBOM to trust (mitigated by documenting channel 3 as authoritative)
- Syft's output may differ from GitHub's built-in Dependency Graph export (channel 1) — this is inherent and documented

### Neutral

- `anchore/sbom-action` is pinned to a commit SHA per ADR-004
- The `sbom.yml` workflow uses the same repository-guard pattern as other optional workflows (ADR-011)
- CycloneDX VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) support could be added later as a follow-up
