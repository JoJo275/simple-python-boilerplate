## Status Definitions

| Status         | Meaning                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deprecated** | The decision is no longer valid due to changed circumstances   |
| **Superseded** | A newer ADR has replaced this one (linked in the supersession) |
| **Suspended**  | The decision is on hold pending further evaluation             |

## Archive Process

When archiving an ADR:

1. Update the ADR's status in its YAML frontmatter or Status section
2. Add a brief note explaining why it was archived
3. Move the file to this directory
4. Update the main ADR index (`docs/adr/README.md`)
