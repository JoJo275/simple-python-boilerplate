# ADR 024: CI gate pattern for branch protection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Branch protection (ADR 023) requires listing every CI workflow that must pass before a PR can merge.  As the project grows, this creates maintenance friction:

- **Adding a workflow** requires a trip to Settings → Branches → Edit protection → add the new check name.
- **Renaming a workflow job** silently breaks protection — the old name is "pending" forever, the new name isn't required.
- **Path-filtered workflows** (bandit, link-checker) don't run on every PR, so they can't be listed as required without blocking unrelated changes.

We evaluated three approaches:

| Approach | How it works | Trade-off |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **List every check individually** | Add each job name to branch protection | Must update Settings whenever a workflow changes; path-filtered workflows block unrelated PRs |
| **Mega-workflow** | One `ci.yml` with `needs:` between all jobs | Loses per-workflow triggers, permissions, and independent failure isolation (ADR 003) |
| **Fan-in gate** | A thin polling job watches the Checks API and reports a single pass/fail | One required check in branch protection; workflow list maintained in code, not Settings |

## Decision

Add a **ci-gate workflow** (`ci-gate.yml`) that:

1. Triggers on `pull_request` and `push` to `main` (same as most check workflows).
2. Uses `actions/github-script` to poll the GitHub Checks API for a configurable list of required check names.
3. Reports a single `gate` status: pass if all required checks pass, fail if any fail, wait if any are pending.

In branch protection, only **`gate`** is set as the required status check.

### What goes in the required list

Workflows that **always run on every PR** are listed as required:

| Check name | Workflow |
|-----------|----------|
| `Ruff (lint & format)` | lint-format.yml |
| `mypy (strict)` | type-check.yml |
| `Spell check (codespell)` | spellcheck.yml |
| `Test + upload coverage` | coverage.yml |
| `Test (Python 3.11)` | test.yml |
| `Test (Python 3.12)` | test.yml |
| `Test (Python 3.13)` | test.yml |
| `pip-audit` | security-audit.yml |
| `Scan dependencies` | dependency-review.yml |
| `Build container image` | container-build.yml |
| `Conventional commit check` | pr-title.yml |
| `Validate commit messages` | commit-lint.yml |

### What stays outside the gate

**Path-filtered workflows** are excluded because they don't run on every PR.  If they ran, the gate would wait forever for a check that will never appear:

| Workflow | Path filter | Why excluded |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| bandit.yml | `src/**`, `scripts/**`, `experiments/**`, `pyproject.toml` | Doesn't run on docs-only or CI-only PRs |
| link-checker.yml | `**/*.md`, `**/*.html`, `docs/**` | Doesn't run on code-only PRs |

These workflows still provide value:
- They report status when they *do* run (visible red ✗ on the PR).
- They run on `push` to `main` and on a weekly schedule, so nothing slips through permanently.
- Reviewers can see the red check and block merge manually.

### Why not a mega-workflow

A single file with `needs:` between all jobs would:
- Violate ADR 003 (separate workflow files per concern)
- Force all jobs onto the same trigger — losing path filters, independent schedules, and per-workflow permissions
- Make diffs noisier and debugging harder
- Require a full CI re-run when any single job is re-triggered

The fan-in gate preserves full independence of every workflow file while centralising the "is everything green?" question.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **One required check** — Branch protection only references `gate`; no Settings changes when workflows are added, removed, or renamed
- **Workflow list in code** — The `REQUIRED_CHECKS` array is version-controlled, reviewable, and self-documenting
- **Preserves ADR 003** — Every workflow keeps its own file, triggers, and permissions
- **Graceful with path filters** — Path-filtered workflows are simply omitted from the list
- **Self-healing** — If a check is re-run, the gate picks up the latest result automatically

### Negative

- **Polling delay** — The gate polls every 15 seconds; adds ~15 s of latency after the last check finishes
- **API rate limits** — Each poll is one Checks API call; 120 polls × 15 s = 30 min ceiling.  Well within GitHub's 1,000 requests/hour limit for `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- **Name coupling** — `REQUIRED_CHECKS` references job *display names*, which can drift if someone renames a job's `name:` field without updating the gate.  Mitigated by code review and the fact that the gate will fail loudly (timeout) if a name is wrong.
- **Doesn't enforce path-filtered checks** — bandit and link-checker failures are advisory, not blocking.  Acceptable because they also run on push to `main` and on schedules.

## Implementation

- [.github/workflows/ci-gate.yml](../../.github/workflows/ci-gate.yml) — Fan-in gate workflow
- [ADR 023](023-branch-protection-rules.md) — Branch protection rules (update required checks to reference `gate` only)
