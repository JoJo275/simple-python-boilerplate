# MkDocs Build Hooks

Custom [MkDocs hooks](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#hooks)
that run during the documentation build. These are **not** git hooks or
pre-commit hooks — they are Python modules that MkDocs calls at specific
points in its build pipeline.

<!-- TODO (template users): Add or remove hooks as needed. If you have no
     repo-relative links in your docs, you can safely delete repo_links.py
     and remove the hooks: entry from mkdocs.yml. -->

## What Are MkDocs Hooks?

MkDocs hooks are plain Python files registered in `mkdocs.yml` under the
`hooks:` key. Each file can define one or more **event handler functions**
that MkDocs calls during the build lifecycle. They are essentially
lightweight plugins that don't require packaging or installation.

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml
hooks:
  - mkdocs-hooks/repo_links.py
```

### Hooks vs Plugins

| Aspect          | Hooks                            | Plugins                                      |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Location**    | Local Python files in the repo   | Installed packages (PyPI or local)            |
| **Registration**| `hooks:` key in `mkdocs.yml`     | `plugins:` key in `mkdocs.yml`               |
| **Config**      | Read `config.extra` or hardcode  | Dedicated config schema via `BasePlugin`      |
| **Packaging**   | None — just a `.py` file         | Requires `setup.py` / `pyproject.toml`       |
| **Best for**    | Project-specific build tweaks    | Reusable, configurable extensions             |

Use hooks for project-specific logic that doesn't need to be shared.
Promote to a plugin if the logic is reusable across multiple projects.

## Adding a New Hook

1. Create a Python file in `mkdocs-hooks/` (e.g. `mkdocs-hooks/my_hook.py`)
2. Define one or more event handler functions (see table above)
3. Register it in `mkdocs.yml`:

   ```yaml
   hooks:
     - mkdocs-hooks/repo_links.py
     - mkdocs-hooks/my_hook.py
   ```

4. Update this README with the new hook's purpose
5. Test with `hatch run docs:build` and `hatch run docs:serve`

### Example Hook

```python
"""MkDocs hook: add build timestamp to page context."""

from __future__ import annotations

from datetime import datetime, timezone
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from mkdocs.config.defaults import MkDocsConfig
    from mkdocs.structure.nav import Navigation
    from mkdocs.structure.pages import Page

HOOK_VERSION = "1.0.0"

def on_page_context(
    context: dict,
    *,
    page: Page,
    config: MkDocsConfig,
    nav: Navigation,
) -> dict:
    """Add build_time to the template context."""
    context["build_time"] = datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc).isoformat()
    return context
```

---

## Conventions

- **Naming:** `snake_case.py`, descriptive of what the hook does
- **Version constant:** Include `HOOK_VERSION = "x.y.z"` — bump when
  behaviour changes
- **Type hints:** Use `TYPE_CHECKING` guard for MkDocs imports (they're
  only available at build time)
- **Docstrings:** Module-level docstring explaining purpose, mechanism,
  and any configuration
- **Logging:** Use `logging.getLogger("mkdocs.hooks.<name>")` for
  build-time messages
- **Independence:** Hooks should not import from the installed package
  (`simple_python_boilerplate`). They run during docs build, not at
  application runtime.
