# Development dependencies for simple-python-boilerplate
#
# This file is OPTIONAL. The source of truth for dependencies is
# pyproject.toml, managed via Hatch (https://hatch.pypa.io/).
# Preferred install methods:
#   pip install -e ".[dev]"   (editable install with dev deps)
#   hatch shell               (enter Hatch-managed dev environment)
#
# This file exists for tools and workflows that require a requirements file
# (e.g., pip-audit, Dependabot, Docker builds without Hatch).
# Keep it in sync with [project.optional-dependencies].dev in pyproject.toml.
