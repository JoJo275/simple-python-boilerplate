## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Do NOT open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)**
   Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/JoJo275/simple-python-boilerplate/security/advisories/new) to submit a report directly.

   <!-- TODO (template users): Replace the advisory URL above with your own:
        https://github.com/YOURNAME/YOURREPO/security/advisories/new -->

   > ℹ️ _If you forked this repo, update the link above to point to your own repository._

2. **Email**
   Contact the maintainers directly at: `joseph26584@gmail.com`

   <!-- Security contact email last verified: 2026-03-03 -->

3. **PGP Encrypted Email** (Optional)
   For sensitive communications, you may encrypt your report using our PGP key.

   **What is PGP?** PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a public-key encryption
   system used to sign and encrypt data. In practice, most people use
   [GnuPG (GPG)](https://gnupg.org/) — the free, open-source implementation
   of the OpenPGP standard. You generate a key pair: a **public key** you
   share (so others can encrypt messages to you) and a **private key** you
   keep secret (to decrypt those messages). PGP is widely used for securing
   email, verifying software signatures, and signing git commits.

   > **Download:** [gnupg.org/download](https://gnupg.org/download/) —
   > On Windows, install [Gpg4win](https://gpg4win.org/) which bundles
   > GnuPG with the Kleopatra key manager GUI.

   > **Windows PATH setup:** After installing Gpg4win, the `gpg` command
   > may not be available in your terminal. You need to add the GnuPG
   > `bin` directory to your system PATH.
   >
   > **Option A — PowerShell commands:**
   >
   > ```powershell
   > # Temporary — current session only:
   > $env:Path += ";C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin"
   >
   > # Permanent — persists across all future sessions (requires admin):
   > [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin", "Machine")
   > ```
   >
   > **Option B — Windows GUI:**
   >
   > 1. Find the install location (typically
   >    `C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin`)
   > 2. Open **Start → Settings → System → About → Advanced system
   >    settings → Environment Variables**
   > 3. Under **System variables**, select **Path** → **Edit** → **New**
   > 4. Paste the `bin` path (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin`)
   > 5. Click **OK** on all dialogs
   >
   > After either method, **restart your terminal** (or VS Code) for
   > the change to take effect. Verify with: `gpg --version`

   **Why RSA 4096-bit?** RSA is one of the most widely supported key
   algorithms. A 4096-bit key length provides a large security margin
   against brute-force attacks and is recommended for long-lived keys
   (e.g., security contact keys that may stay in use for years). While
   3072-bit is currently considered secure, 4096-bit costs little extra
   and future-proofs the key.

   <!-- TODO (template users): Enable PGP for security reports by following
        the steps below. Once complete, uncomment the fingerprint/URL block
        at the bottom of this section.
   -->

   **How to set up PGP with RSA 4096-bit:**

   1. **Generate a key pair:**

      ```bash
      gpg --full-generate-key
      ```

      When prompted, select:
      - Key type: **(1) RSA and RSA**
      - Key size: **4096**
      - Expiration: choose an appropriate validity period (e.g., `2y` for 2 years, or `0` for no expiry)
      - Enter your name and the email address associated with this project
      - **Comment** (optional): A short label for the key's purpose, e.g.,
        `Security contact key for simple-python-boilerplate` — or leave it
        blank if you prefer. The comment appears in the key's User ID
        alongside your name and email.
      - Set a strong passphrase when prompted

   2. **Get your key fingerprint:**

      ```bash
      gpg --fingerprint YOUR_EMAIL
      ```

      This will show two fingerprints:
      - **`pub`** — your primary (master) key, used for signing and
        certification. **This is the fingerprint you want.** Copy the
        40-character hex string (e.g., `ABCD 1234 EFGH 5678 ...`).
      - **`sub`** — your subkey, automatically generated for encryption.
        You can ignore this one for the steps below. It's safely stored
        in your local GPG keyring — you can always view it again with:

        ```bash
        gpg --list-keys --keyid-format long YOUR_EMAIL
        ```

   3. **Publish to a keyserver** (so reporters can find your key):

      ```bash
      gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --send-keys YOUR_FINGERPRINT
      ```

      > **Important:** Pass the fingerprint as one continuous string with
      > **no spaces** (e.g., `28D9F503F630CAA342DE...`). If you include
      > spaces, GPG treats each chunk as a separate key ID and fails with
      > `"not a key ID: skipping"`.

      > **Keyserver delay:** After uploading, `keys.openpgp.org` requires
      > you to **verify your email** before the key is publicly searchable
      > by email address. Check your inbox (and spam folder) for a
      > verification email from the keyserver. Until you verify, the key
      > is published but only findable by fingerprint, not by email.
      > This can take a few minutes to arrive.

   4. **Export the public key and commit it to the repo root:**

      ```bash
      # Export the ASCII-armored public key
      gpg --armor --export YOUR_EMAIL > pgp-key.asc

      # Stage and commit the key file
      git add pgp-key.asc
      git commit -m "chore: add PGP public key for security reports"
      ```

      <!-- TODO (template users): After committing pgp-key.asc, consider
           adding a note in your README or CONTRIBUTING.md pointing to it
           so reporters know where to find the key. -->

      This makes your public key easily discoverable by anyone cloning the
      repo. Alternatively, you can host it elsewhere and link to it.

      **How reporters use `pgp-key.asc`:**

      When someone discovers a vulnerability, they can encrypt their
      report so only you can read it:

      ```bash
      # Reporter imports your public key
      gpg --import pgp-key.asc

      # Reporter encrypts their vulnerability report
      gpg --encrypt --armor --recipient YOUR_EMAIL report.txt

      # Reporter sends you the encrypted report.txt.asc file
      ```

      You then decrypt it with your private key:

      ```bash
      gpg --decrypt report.txt.asc
      ```

      This prevents sensitive vulnerability details from being readable
      if the email is intercepted.

   5. **Update the fingerprint and public key URL below:**

      Replace the placeholder values with your actual fingerprint and
      keyserver search URL, then remove the `<!-- -->` comment markers
      surrounding the block (if still commented out).

      - **Key fingerprint:** `28D9 F503 F630 CAA3 42DE  6486 673F A94A 2F1C 9513`
      - **Public key:** <https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=joseph26584@gmail.com>

## Security Best Practices

When using or contributing to this project:

1. **Use Hatch for environments** — Run `hatch shell` or `hatch run <cmd>` instead of global pip installs. Never install packages outside a virtual environment.
2. **Keep dependencies updated** — Run `task deps:outdated` or `task deps:versions` to check. Dependabot handles this automatically for the GitHub repo.
3. **Run security checks locally** — `task security` (bandit) and `task pre-commit:run` catch issues before they reach CI.
4. **Review code before running** — Especially scripts from untrusted sources.
5. **Don't commit secrets** — Gitleaks runs on pre-push, but avoid putting secrets in code in the first place. Use environment variables or GitHub Secrets.
6. **Keep GitHub Actions pinned** — Use `task actions:versions` to audit and `task actions:upgrade` to update SHA pins.
7. **Review Dependabot PRs** — Don't blindly merge. Check changelogs for breaking changes.
